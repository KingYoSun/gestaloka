# Type Error Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-29

### Files Modified:
1. `/backend/app/tasks/dispatch_tasks.py`
2. `/backend/app/services/ai/dispatch_simulator.py`
3. `/backend/app/services/ai/dispatch_interaction.py`

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. `objective_details` vs `objective_detail` attribute errors
- **Problem**: Code was trying to access `dispatch.objective_details` (plural) but the model has `objective_detail` (singular) which is a string field, not a dict.
- **Solution**: 
  - In `dispatch_tasks.py`: Replaced logic that tried to access dict fields with simple score additions
  - In `dispatch_simulator.py` and `dispatch_interaction.py`: Added TODO comments and stored the data in `travel_log` instead
  - This is a temporary fix - the proper solution would be to either:
    - Change the model to have a JSON field for storing detailed objectives
    - Create separate fields/tables for storing economic, memory, and research details

#### 2. datetime subtraction with None
- **Problem**: `datetime.utcnow() - dispatch.dispatched_at` when `dispatched_at` could be None
- **Solution**: Added None check: `if dispatch.dispatched_at else 0` or `if dispatch.dispatched_at else "0:00:00"`

#### 3. PromptContext unexpected keyword argument 'action'
- **Problem**: PromptContext doesn't have an `action` parameter in its constructor
- **Solution**: Moved `action` to the `additional_context` dict parameter

#### 4. CompletedLog personality vs personality_traits attribute error
- **Problem**: Code was accessing `completed_log.personality` but the model has `personality_traits` (which is a list)
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced all occurrences of `.personality` with `.personality_traits`
  - Updated logic that was treating it as a string to handle it as a list

#### 5. Additional fixes in dispatch_interaction.py:
- Changed `dispatch.player_id` to `dispatch.dispatcher_id`
- Added missing fields to `InteractionOutcome` class: `narrative` and `outcome`
- Added `relationship_change=0.0` to InteractionOutcome constructor calls

### Design Issues Identified:

1. **objective_detail field mismatch**: The model has `objective_detail` as a string, but the code expects it to be a dict containing structured data like economic_details, memory_details, etc. This needs a proper redesign.

2. **Data storage pattern**: The current workaround stores additional data in the `travel_log` field, which is not ideal. A better approach would be to:
   - Create separate models for different types of dispatch objectives
   - Or use a proper JSON field for storing structured objective data

### Recommendations:

1. **Model Redesign**: Consider changing `objective_detail` to a JSON field or creating separate models for different dispatch types.

2. **Type Safety**: Add more type hints and use mypy in CI/CD to catch these errors earlier.

3. **Testing**: Add unit tests that would have caught these attribute access errors.
